HOW TO BUILD GNSS-SDR
----------------------

This document describes how to set up the compilation environment and build GNSS-SDR (tested: Ubuntu 10.04, 10.10, 11.04 and 11.10)

* Install GNU Radio:

- Downloading, building and installing GNU Radio and all its dependencies is not a simple task. We recommend to use Marcus Leech's build-gnuradio script, which automatically does all the work for you. In a terminal, do:

$ wget http://www.sbrac.org/files/build-gnuradio
$ chmod a+x build-gnuradio
$ ./build-gnuradio

This can take a while (up to two hours to complete, depending on your system), and installs the latest versions of UHD and GNU Radio in your system, including all their dependencies. In case you do not want to use the script and prefer to build and install GNU Radio manually from source, follow instructions in http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/BuildGuide

- Set up some system variables needed by the GNSS-SDR build system:

export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
export GNURADIO_ROOT=/path/to/gnuradio
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib

where /path/to/gnuradio is the folder in which you invoked build-gnuradio. In order to avoid defining these variables each time you enter a session, you may want to add these three lines to your $HOME/.bashrc file.

* Install other libraries used by GNSS-SDR:

- Download, compile, and install the Armadillo linear algebra library

$ wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/arma/files/armadillo-2.4.2.tar.gz
$ tar xvfz armadillo-2.4.2.tar.gz
$ cd armadillo-2.4.2
$ cmake .
$ make
$ sudo make install

The full stop separated from "cmake" by a space is important. CMake will figure out what other libraries are currently installed and will modify Armadillo's configuration correspondingly. CMake will also generate a run-time armadillo library, which is a combined alias for all the relevant libraries present on your system (eg. BLAS, LAPACK and ATLAS).

NOTE: ATLAS version 3.6 is know to cause random crashes and incorrect results under Ubuntu. The minimum recommended version is 3.8. It is a good idea to completely remove ATLAS 3.6 from your system, in case you have it, as it intercepts calls to BLAS and LAPACK. 

- Download, unzip, configure, build and install Google's performance analysis tools, google-perftools:

$ wget http://google-perftools.googlecode.com/files/google-perftools-1.9.1.tar.gz 
$ tar xvfz google-perftools-1.9.1.tar.gz 
$ cd  google-perftools-1.9.1
$ ./configure --enable-frame-pointers
$ make
$ sudo make install

NOTE: At this moment (Dec. 2011), perftools seems to be not working properly in Ubuntu 11.10. See  http://code.google.com/p/google-perftools/issues/detail?id=386

- Download, unzip, configure, and build Google C++ Testing Framework (also known as Google Test):

$ wget http://googletest.googlecode.com/files/gtest-1.6.0.zip
$ unzip gtest-1.6.0.zip
$ cd gtest-1.6.0
$ ./configure
$ make

- Download, unzip, configure, build and install Google's gflags package, a commandline flags processing module for C++:

$ wget http://google-gflags.googlecode.com/files/gflags-1.7.tar.gz
$ tar xvfz gflags-1.7.tar.gz
$ cd gflags-1.7
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

- Download, unzip, configure, build and install glog, a Google's library that implements application-level logging:

$ wget http://google-glog.googlecode.com/files/glog-0.3.1-1.tar.gz 
$ tar xvfz glog-0.3.1-1.tar.gz 
$ cd  glog-0.3.1
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

- Install Subversion

$ sudo apt-get install subversion

* Check out the latest version of GNSS-SDR

$ svn co http://gnss-sdr.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gnss-sdr gnss-sdr

* Build GNSS-SDR

- Go to GNSS-SDR's root directory and compile the program:

$ cd gnss-sdr/trunk
$ bjam

If everything went fine, a executable will be found at gnss-sdr/trunk/install/gnss-sdr


NOTE: If, later on, you want to bring your GNU Radio repository up to date with the original repository of GNU Radio (and test if GNSS-SDR works with it), go to the gnuradio directory and do:

$ sudo make uninstall
$ make clean
$ git pull
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check
$ sudo make install
