(11/12/2010) GSL AND CBLAS ARITHMETIC

In order to compile the arithmetic tests, the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) library package is needed.
Install the ubuntu package with:

sudo apt-get install libgsl0ldbl


To build the project type call bjam from the project root folder.

PROFILING

In order to do profiling, you'll have to install google-perftools library.
- Download google-perftools-1.5.tar.gz from http://code.google.com/p/google-perftools.
- Unpack google-perftools-1.5.tar.gz into some folder.
- From the folder containing google-perftools, build and install the libraries:
	- PERFTOOLS$ ./configure
	- PERFTOOLS$ make
	- PERFTOOLS$ sudo make install
	
Once google-perftools is installed, you can use the script "profiler" which is placed 
in the root folder of MERCURIO sources. The script must be run as root since it makes use
of "nice". The result of the profiling are two files, mercurio.cpu.prof and mercurio.head.prof.0001.heap,
that contain the results for CPU and HEAP profiling. You can use google-perftools' script pprof
to analyze the recorded data.

(Sample of .bashrc configuration)

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/lib
export GNURADIO_330_ROOT=/home/gnss/sdr/gnuradio-3.3.0
