How to set up the compilation environment for Ubuntu 9.10 and 10.04

- Download GNU Radio 3.3.0 from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnuradio
- Compile and install following the instructions at http://gnuradio.org/redmine/wiki/1/UbuntuInstall
- Install bjam with the command 'sudo apt-get install bjam'
- Install Boost.Build with the command 'sudo apt-get install boost-build'
- Add the system variable GNURADIO_330_ROOT with the location of the sources of gnuradio-3.3.0 
- Download gtest-1.4.0.tar.gz from http://code.google.com/p/googletest.
- Unpack gtest-1.4.0.tar.gz into some folder.
- From the folder containing gtest build the libraries and install them:
	- GTEST$ ./configure
	- GTEST$ make
	- GTEST$ make check
	- GTEST$ sudo make install
- Add the following line to your .bashrc:
	- export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/lib
- Download glog-0.3.0.tar.gz from http://code.google.com/p/google-glog.
- Unpack glog-0.3.0.tar.gz into some folder.
- From the folder containing glog, build and install the libraries:
	- GLOG$ ./configure
	- GLOG$ make
	- GLOG$ sudo make install
	NOTE: THE LOG FILES ARE STORED BY DEFAULT /TMP/
- Download gflags-1.3.tar.gz from http://code.google.com/p/google-gflags.
- Unpack gflags-1.3.tar.gz into some folder.
- From the folder containing gflags, build the libraries and install them:
	- GFLAGS$ ./configure
	- GFLAGS$ make
	- GFLAGS$ sudo make install
	
 - (28/11/2011) Download, compile, and install the Armadillo linear algebra library
 	1. Download the latest stable version from http://arma.sourceforge.net/
 	2. Unpack it
 	3. Open a shell, change into the directory that was
  	created by unpacking the armadillo archive, and type the following
  	commands:
  	cmake .
  	make 
 	The full stop separated from "cmake" by a space is important.
  	CMake will figure out what other libraries are currently installed
  	and will modify Armadillo's configuration correspondingly.
  	CMake will also generate a run-time armadillo library, which is a 
  	combined alias for all the relevant libraries present on your system
  	(eg. BLAS, LAPACK and ATLAS).
  	4. Install the library
  	sudo make install
  	
(11/12/2010) GSL AND CBLAS ARITHMETIC

In order to compile the arithmetic tests, the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) library package is needed.
Install the ubuntu package with:

sudo apt-get install libgsl0ldbl


To build the project type call bjam from the project root folder.

PROFILING

In order to do profiling, you'll have to install google-perftools library.
- Download google-perftools-1.5.tar.gz from http://code.google.com/p/google-perftools.
- Unpack google-perftools-1.5.tar.gz into some folder.
- From the folder containing google-perftools, build and install the libraries:
	- PERFTOOLS$ ./configure
	- PERFTOOLS$ make
	- PERFTOOLS$ sudo make install
	
Once google-perftools is installed, you can use the script "profiler" which is placed 
in the root folder of MERCURIO sources. The script must be run as root since it makes use
of "nice". The result of the profiling are two files, mercurio.cpu.prof and mercurio.head.prof.0001.heap,
that contain the results for CPU and HEAP profiling. You can use google-perftools' script pprof
to analyze the recorded data.

(Sample of .bashrc configuration)

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/lib
export GNURADIO_330_ROOT=/home/gnss/sdr/gnuradio-3.3.0
