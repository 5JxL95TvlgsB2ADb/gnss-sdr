How to set up the compilation environment and build GNSS-SDR in Ubuntu:

* Install GNU Radio:

- Downloading, building and installing GNU Radio and all its dependencies is not an easy task. We recommend to use Marcus Leech's build-gnuradio script, which automatically does all the work for you. In a terminal, do:

$ wget http://www.sbrac.org/files/build-gnuradio
$ chmod a+x build-gnuradio
$ ./build-gnuradio

This can take a while (up to two hours to complete, depending on the system), and installs the latest versions of UHD and GNU Radio in your system, including all their dependencies.

- Set up some system variables needed by the GNSS-SDR build system:

export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
export GNURADIO_ROOT=/path/to/gnuradio
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib

where /path/to/gnuradio is the folder in which you invoked build-gnuradio. In orderto avoid defining these variables each time you enter a session, you may want to add these three lines to your $HOME/.bashrc file.

* Install other libraries used by GNSS-SDR:

- Download, compile, and install the Armadillo linear algebra library

$ wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/arma/files/armadillo-2.4.2.tar.gz
$ tar xvfz armadillo-2.4.2.tar.gz
$ cd armadillo-2.4.2
$ cmake .
$ make
$ sudo make install

The full stop separated from "cmake" by a space is important. CMake will figure out what other libraries are currently installed and will modify Armadillo's configuration correspondingly. CMake will also generate a run-time armadillo library, which is a combined alias for all the relevant libraries present on your system (eg. BLAS, LAPACK and ATLAS).

- Download, unzip, configure, build and install Google's performance analysis tools, google-perftools:

$ wget http://google-perftools.googlecode.com/files/google-perftools-1.8.3.tar.gz 
$ tar xvfz google-perftools-1.8.3.tar.gz 
$ cd  google-perftools-1.8.3
$ ./configure --enable-frame-pointers
$ make
$ sudo make install

NOTE: At this moment (Dec. 2011), perftools seems to be not working properly in Ubuntu 11.10. See  http://code.google.com/p/google-perftools/issues/detail?id=386

- Download, unzip, configure, and build Google C++ Testing Framework (also known as Google Test):

$ wget http://googletest.googlecode.com/files/gtest-1.6.0.zip
$ unzip gtest-1.6.0.zip
$ cd gtest-1.6.0
$ ./configure
$ make

- Download, unzip, configure, build and install the gflags package, a commandline flags processing module for C++:

$ wget http://google-gflags.googlecode.com/files/gflags-1.7.tar.gz
$ tar xvfz gflags-1.7.tar.gz
$ cd gflags-1.7
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

- Download, unzip, configure, build and install Google's library that implements application-level logging, glog:

$ wget http://google-glog.googlecode.com/files/glog-0.3.1-1.tar.gz 
$ tar xvfz glog-0.3.1-1.tar.gz 
$ cd  glog-0.3.1
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

- Install Subversion

$ sudo apt-get install subversion

* Check out the latest version of GNSS-SDR

$ svn co http://gnss-sdr.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gnss-sdr gnss-sdr

* Build GNSS-SDR

- Go to GNSS-SDR's root directory and compile the program:

$ cd gnss-sdr/trunk
$ bjam

If everything went fine, a executable will be found at gnss-sdr/trunk/install/gnss-sdr


NOTE: If you want to update the master branch of GNU Radio (and test if GNSS-SDR works with it) , go to the gnuradio directory and do:

sudo make uninstall
make clean
git pull
./configure
make
make check
sudo make install
